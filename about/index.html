<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Christopher Fisher</h1> <hr />
	<p>I'm currently an active duty Infantry Marine going through the MSSA Course for Cloud Applications Developer. I would really like to get into the IT Industry so that I can utilize technology to help create our future. It's also very fun to work with because it provides me with tools I can use to tell a story with.</p>
	<h2> Hobbies </h2>
	<p> Some of my hobbies include working out (I like to powerlift, I've competed in a strongman competition and I have PRs of 315lbs Bench, 500lb Back Squat, and 545lb Deadlift)
	I also enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and I play Trumpet and Guitar, although not as often as I would like to anymore. Whenever I get the chance I enjoy reading, playing video games, and writing. Writing is something I like to do but definitely don't practice enough.
	My imagination runs wild sometimes and I get a lot of ideas for things, but I have never really found the best way to transpose those thoughts onto paper, so that is something I will be working on
	as I continue putting out projects.</p>
	<p> My interest in technology developed from playing video games. I used to mod the original Halo PC back when I was 10-11 years old, from simple mods such as editing tags, putting AI on multiplayer maps, and putting single player maps into multiplayer levels.
		I developed an interest in sandbox MMOs such as Star Wars Galaxies and helped contribute on test servers. Star Wars Galaxies is one of my all time favorite games and I have always wanted to help code the emualators for it.
		I have also built my own computer (since then I've gotten a newer PC, and the mobo on my self-built computer died :( ) </p>
