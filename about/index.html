<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Christopher Fisher</h1> <hr />
	<p>I'm currently an active duty Infantry Marine going through the MSSA Course for Cloud Applications Developer. I would really like to get into the IT Industry so that I can utilize technology to help create our future. It's also very fun to work with becuase it provides me with tools I can use to tell a story with</p>
	<h2> Hobbies </h2>
	<p> Some of my hobbies include working out (I like to powerlift, I've competed in a strongman competition and I have PRs of 315lbs Bench, 500lb Back Squat, and 545lb Deadlift)
	I also play Trumpet and Guitar, not as often as I would like to anymore. Whenever I get the chance I enjoy reading, and playing video games. </p>
