	<h1>Christopher Fisher</h1> <hr />
	<p>I'm a transitioning Marine with a background in the Infantry. Throughout my time in the Marine Corps I carried many responsiblities that provided me great opportunities to lead, teach, and learn.
		Right now I'm going through the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy for Cloud Application Development, which has been a great opportunity to work back into technology.
		Growing up, I've always had a huge interest in technology and its capabilities. Everything from Computers, Machines, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Astronomy, and whatever else you could name have always fascinated me.
		To be able to get into programming and create my own applications which will continue to evolve with my knowledge is simply a wonderful experience.
		As I continue to learn I'm looking to work into Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, looking to attain a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering within the next 4 years.
		</p>
	<h2> Hobbies </h2>
	<p> Some of my hobbies include working out (I like to powerlift, I've competed in a strongman competition and I have PRs of 315lbs Bench, 500lb Back Squat, and 545lb Deadlift)
	I also enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and I play Trumpet and Guitar, I fiddle around with the Keyboard every now and then, and I'm starting to work into Percussion as well. Whenever I get the chance I also enjoy reading, playing video games, and writing.
	</p>
	<p> My interest in technology derived from playing video games and my fascination with space travel at a young age. I've always fancied the idea of space exploration and dreamt of making it possible.
		I'm hoping that with my work in technology I can help contribute to the exponential development of technology in itself, and help create our future.
