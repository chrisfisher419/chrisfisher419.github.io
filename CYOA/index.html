  <h1> CYOA Series </h1>
  <p> I currently do not have a name for this series, and the rest of the installments will come later on in the future since I'm currently moving on to learn more advanced things in unit. 
    with this, I am just hoping to tell a small story, futuristic/sci-fi related, something like <i>Mass Effect</i> mixed with the <u>A Space Odyssey</u> series and some <i> Interstellar </i> maybe. <p>
